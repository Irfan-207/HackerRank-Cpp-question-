## Introduction
This repository contains solutions to HackerRank problems. Each solution is thoroughly documented and optimized for performance. My aim is to provide clear, efficient code that can help others understand different problem-solving strategies.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Each problem has its own directory containing the solution code (`main.cpp`) and a `README.md` with problem details and explanations.

## Features
- **Efficient Solutions**: My solutions are optimized for performance.
- **Clear Documentation**: Each problem directory contains a `README.md` explaining the approach and logic used.
- **Modular Code**: Solutions are modular and easy to understand.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Irfan-207/HackerRank-Cpp-question.git
```
## Usage
- Open the problem directory you are interested in.
- Compile and run the solution:
```sh
g++ problem_name/main.cpp -o problem_name/solution./problem_name/solution
```
